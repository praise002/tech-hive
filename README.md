# Tech Hive
![Django Tests](https://github.com/praise002/tech-hive/actions/workflows/django-tests.yml/badge.svg)

This repository contains the full-stack source code for the Tech Hive project, organized into two main folders:

- backend/: Django backend API, authentication, and business logic. See README.md for backend-specific details.
- frontend/: React frontend application. See README.md for frontend-specific details.
  
## Getting Started
Each folder includes its own setup instructions. Please refer to the respective README files in backend and frontend for installation and usage.

Tech Hive is designed as a modern web application with a clear separation between backend and frontend codebases.
